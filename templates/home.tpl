The principle is pretty easy, each hour you give your skills to someone else, you earn an hour you can spend with someone else for anythhing else you want.
Every services offered on Shareece  is valued by the time someone spends rather than what someone would pay in the market economy. We want to create a new way of thinking about community, create an alternative to a typical social network–one that brings people together to help each other out starting building ongoing relathionships that usually end up as friends. It’s also a way to bring together people who likely would never have met otherwise.</p>
